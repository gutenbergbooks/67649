<h2>Our Best Greetings to You</h2>


<p>Christmas! And the bells are clanging! Christmas! And the goose is
hanging high and joy’s abroad! Christmas is the happy season! Though
the weather may be freezin’, human hearts are thawed! Here we see
the ancient codger sporting like an artful dodger with the laughing
kids; here we see the haughty chappie smiling broadly and as happy
as the katydids. Every one has shed his sorrow, dropped his burden
till tomorrow, dropped the world and care; Christmas is no time for
sadness&mdash;all the world is full of gladness, each should have his share.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you deal in lumber, let your business rest and slumber,
till the day is o’er; think no more of lath and plaster; frolic fast
and frolic faster till you split the floor. Cast aside all thoughts of
timber; show the folks your legs are limber, and your soul unspoiled;
show your heart has not been toughened, show your nature’s not been
roughened, by the years you’ve toiled. Let no thoughts of sash and
siding your attention be dividing on this day of grace; help to fill
with glee your shanty, till grandmother, sister, auntie, bless your
cheer-up face.</p>

<p>Christmas! When the reindeer travel, and Old Santa scratches gravel,
making good his dates! Men who don’t get good and mellow when is due
that brave old fellow, surely are cheap skates. When the Christmas
music’s rollin’, and the children’s socks are swollen, we should all
be young; young as when we watched and waited for those reindeer,
rapid-gaited, by the night wind stung. We can be as young in spirit as
the kids, or pretty near it, if we only try, though our heads are gray
and dusty and our joints are worn and rusty, and no longer spry. Then
when Christmas time is ended and we to our tasks have wended, we shall
bear away something of the youth we captured when the whole world was
enraptured with its Christmas day.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Walt_Mason">Walt Mason<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="small">&mdash;Everybody’s Poet</span></h2>
</div>



<p>Walt Mason is a poet and the world knows it. He is read by more people
than any other living writer. His prose rhymes are published in 200
daily newspapers with an aggregate circulation of about 12 millions.
Walt says his only claim on the nation’s gratitude is that he does not
go about the country reading from his “works.” Indeed, he doesn’t have
to, for his writings are read with avidity by hosts of people.</p>

<p>Walt Mason lives in Emporia, Kansas, most of the time, but spends
his summers in Estes Park, Colorado. He does nothing but write prose
rhymes. And at this job he is one of the hardest working men living. He
is probably the only poet who makes his living solely by the sweat of
his brow.</p>

<p>Many people have wondered what Walt Mason gets for his contributions to
<span class="smcap">Curtis Service</span>. This is rather a personal question but it is
sufficient to say that he gets enough money from work of this kind so
that his monthly income has totalled as high as $875.00. At any rate,
this was the figure he gave out in an interview in a Kansas City paper
in 1914, and like everything else, prose rhymes weren’t as high then as
they are now.</p>

<p>As Mr. Mason himself explains, he was never a lumber dealer, though he
has tried to sell everything from hardware to hogs.</p>

<p>How, then, can he write lumber lyrics that hit such a responsive chord
in every lumber dealer’s mind? The Lord knows. He was born that way.
His prose rhymes “get under your hide” and under every other lumber
dealer’s hide, because Walt Mason has an interest in you and your
fellow human beings.</p>

<p>Walt Mason was born in Columbus, Ontario, May 4th, 1862. He was the
fifth of six sons of poor parents. When Walt was four years old his
father was accidentally killed. After his mother died, when he was
fifteen, he went to Port Hope, Ontario, and worked in a hardware store
for $2.50 a week, boarding himself. He soon forsook the hardware
business, in 1880, and crossed Lake Ontario into New York State, where
he hoed beans until he decided that there wasn’t any sense in hoeing
beans.</p>

<p>“Arm in arm with the star of empire,” he took his course westward,
stopping in Ohio and in Illinois, and then in St.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span> Louis. There he
wrote “some stuff” for a humorous weekly called <i>The Hornet</i>,
which obtained for him a position at $5.00 per week doing everything
from writing gems of thought to sweeping the floors.</p>

<p>When <i>The Hornet</i> went broke, Mason continued westward and worked
for three years as a hired man in Kansas. He became disgusted with the
work and managed to get a position with the <i>Leavenworth Times</i>.
From there he floated to the <i>Atchison Globe</i>, and was off and on
connected with newspapers in a dozen cities. At last, William Allen
White, publisher of the <i>Emporia Gazette</i>, offered him a position.</p>

<p><i>The Gazette</i> always printed on its first page an item of local
interest with a border around it, called a “star head.” One day,
the city editor was shy the necessary item and asked Walt to write
something to fill the space. He wrote a little prose rhyme asking
people to go to church next day, which was Sunday. The rhyme attracted
attention, and on Monday he wrote another one, and a little later on,
Walt and the “star head” became a feature of the <i>Gazette</i>. This
was the origin of the prose poem and that was when Walt Mason came to
himself&mdash;at the age of forty-five.</p>

<p>The rhymes of Walt Mason have had a marked influence on American
literature. Their unusual character have made the “highbrows” wonder
how to class them. His rhymes seem to be neither prose nor poetry,
though it must be remembered that the poems of the classics were
written in lineless form, and therefore, that Mason’s stuff can’t be
condemned simply because it isn’t printed like verse.</p>

<p>Mason used to write for a great many house organs, but today <span class="smcap">Curtis
Service</span>, for which he has been writing since the third issue of
the publication, in September, 1913, is one of the few on his list.</p>

<p>Walt Mason believes that poets are born and not made. At any rate, he
says that they must have an ear for rhyme. The manner in which he sends
in his contributions to <span class="smcap">Curtis Service</span> shows that he doesn’t
chew up many pencils paring down his rhymes and changing them about so
that their feet will toe the mark.</p>

<p>Though he is a poet he has but one eccentricity: he is fat. He tried
out a large number of eccentricities, because he knew all poets had to
have some, but finally decided upon being fat as the one with fewest
drawbacks and the least inconvenient.</p>

<p><i>Who’s Who</i> says he married Ella Foss of Wooster, Ohio, in 1893,
and that he is a Republican in politics and a Unitarian in religion.
His twelve million readers all acclaim him as a “regular guy.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Lumber_Lyrics"><i>Lumber Lyrics</i></h2>
</div>


<p>The prose poems appearing in this little book have been written by
me for the Curtis Companies during the past few years, and, judging
from the many letters I have received from lumber dealers all over the
country, they took kindly to the little effusions; and often these
correspondents have asked me where and when I had experience in the
lumber business.</p>

<p>I have had no experience in that line, except as a customer at the
lumber yards. I have bought a lot of boards and such things in my time,
and when I was buying them, or waiting for my change, I looked around.
Anybody who looks around, and who doesn’t wear blinders, observes many
things in the course of a lifetime.</p>

<p>I have always been interested in the things around me and close to me.
I have an insatiable curiosity; I want to know all the facts about
anything I am interested in. When I go to a lumber yard to buy the
materials for a cupboard or a coffin, I ask a million questions. I want
to know where the boards grew, and who harvested them, and how they
were prepared for the consumer, and all about them; and, as a rule,
lumber men know their own trade, and can give any reasonable amount of
information. I have been asking questions all my days; and, having a
good memory, very few facts get away from me.</p>

<p>And so I am prepared to write a rhyme about anything at an hour’s
notice. If I am to write about a steam engine, or a whale, or the north
pole, I usually do it without consulting any books; at various times
I have questioned people about steam engines, and whales, and north
poles, and the things they told me are on file in my memory.</p>

<p>So with these poems. They have been suggested by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span> things I have heard
lumber men say, perhaps day before yesterday, perhaps twenty years ago.</p>

<p>There are many people who will tell you I am not a poet, and I am not
going to quarrel with them about it. The true poet, in the estimation
of the highbrows, is one who can so befuddle a subject with words that
an ordinary citizen can’t tell what he is driving at. I have never had
an ambition to be that kind of a poet. Really, I can be as cryptic as
any of them, and can write things that would give you a sick headache,
trying to understand them; but few people enjoy sick headaches.</p>

<p>I have never been interested in Greek gods or Lethean rivers, or
things remote, either in time or distance. Most of my life I have been
associated with people who worked hard for a living, and I have done
all kinds of manual labor myself. It is with such people, and such
varieties of labor, that my verses deal.</p>

<p>The lumber yard on the corner is of more enduring interest to me than
the Field of the Cloth of Gold, on which sundry kings played to the
gallery long ago. Every time the lumberman sells a wagonload of his
goods he is contributing to the general welfare, as well as to his own;
and this fact seems more important to me than any story treating of the
doings of Ulysses or any other fabled gent. So I write of lumber and
let the gods slide.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TREES">TREES</h2>
</div>


<p>Most every tree is made of wood; the best ones are remote from cities;
and in their cheerful neighborhood the birds keep singing ragtime
ditties. Beneath their limbs the children play and swing within their
leafy border, upon the long, bright summer day, when picnic parties
are in order. And now and then the poets come, to eulogize the forest
spirit, and you can hear their thought works hum, like auto wheels,
or pretty near it. And it may chance, upon a day, that farmers from
adjacent ranches, will bring a rope along this way, and hang an agent
from the branches.</p>

<p>Now comes the woodman with his ax, and he selects some forest beauty;
then through its noble trunk he whacks&mdash;it is to him a thing of duty.
He has to feed his eighteen kids, he has to clothe his wife and auntie;
he has to buy them pies and lids, and put new paint upon his shanty.
And thus the forest giant falls, there’s none to shield it or deliver;
now other men in overalls, will float it down some rushing river. And
then through loud and busy mills the good old tree in fragments dashes,
and makes its bow as doors and sills, as scantling, joists and window
sashes.</p>

<p>It’s strange to labor at a desk and think that it, all carved and
oaken, one time was standing, picturesque, amid a solitude unbroken;
once in the forest dark and dim, these pigeonholes and doodads rested;
this drawer was once a swaying limb, on which the robin sang and nested.</p>

<p>I sit upon my swivel chair, and meditate upon its hist’ry; these rungs
and legs once waved in air, in all the strange primeval myst’ry.</p>

<p>This stool on which I milk my cow, this club with which I swat the
heifers, though they are quite prosaic now, once rustled in the morning
zephyrs; once they had leaves, and in the dawn they sang the world-old
song of wonder; and in the dusk when day was gone, they saw the smiling
lovers under.</p>

<p>This maple slat with which I soak my Willie when he gets too funny, and
on his daddy plays a joke, came from some woodland sweet and sunny.</p>

<p>And thus in every lumber yard there’s food for pleasant meditation; a
plank inspires the modern bard, and tunes him up to beat creation.</p>

</div>


<p>Winter winds were round us snorting, for a weary while; now that
Spring’s this way cavorting, we should wear a smile.</p>

<p>Tempests, storms and kindred friskers lashed us with a whip, froze our
noses and our whiskers, gave us all the grip.</p>

<p>Nights were cold and days were freezing, cheerless was the sky; we were
coughing, whooping, sneezing, till we wished to die.</p>

<p>Now the winter’s quit its prancing, it’s an also ran; and the gentle
Spring, advancing, should encourage man.</p>

<p>When the north winds, blood congealers, ripped along the earth, ’tisn’t
strange if lumber dealers strangers were to mirth.</p>

<p>For there was no rush or clamor in the building trade; and the rusty
saw and hammer on the shelf were laid.</p>

<p>But, since balmy spring is coming, and old winter’s canned, sounds of
building will be humming over all the land.</p>

<p>When the skies are blue and sunny, and the birdlets sing, people will
be spending money, as they do each spring.</p>

<p>They’ll be building gorgeous houses, all along the pike, shelter for
their steeds and cowses, fences and the like.</p>

<p>So let glee and mellow laughter fill your lumber store, as you hand out
joist and rafter, scantling, sash and door.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="KNOWLEDGE_IS_POWER">KNOWLEDGE IS POWER</h2>
</div>


<p>When I go into someone’s store, to buy a nickel’s worth or more, some
questions I may spring; for I have an inquiring mind; all kinds of
facts I like to find, and place them on a string. I ask the grocer if
his tea was grown beside the Zuyder Zee, or down along the Po; and I’m
disgusted when he sighs, and claws his whiskers and replies, “I really
do not know.”</p>

<p>I hold that every business man should follow up the good old plan and
know his stock in trade; the wise old grocer always knew just where his
shredded codfish grew, and where his prunes were made. The wise old
clothier knows that wool is never gathered from a bull, and tells his
patrons so; that merchant wearies by his acts, who answers, when you
ask for facts, “I’m sure I do not know.”</p>

<p>We have a lumber man named Chee; I asked him, “On what sort of tree do
lath and shingles grow?” He said, “We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span> have the shingles there, and
where they grew I do not care, and neither do I know.” This answer
filled me with amaze; he’d handled shingles all his days, and knew not
whence they came; he’d played his hand for forty years, since he was
wet behind the ears, and didn’t know the game.</p>

<p>We have a lumber man named Dumm; I asked him, “Whence do shingles
come&mdash;oh, whither, why and whence?” He said, “I’m always glad to tell
the history of things I sell, regardless of expense. The shingle
trees,” I hear him say, “are only found at Hudson’s Bay, and they have
stately shapes; the shingles, which are long and slim, profusely grow
on every limb, in bunches, much like grapes. The natives harvest them
in March when they are firm and stiff with starch, and dry them in
the sun; then they remove the outer husk&mdash;which has a gentle smell of
musk&mdash;and thrash them, every one. Then they’re sandpapered, piece by
piece, and boiled six weeks in walrus grease, and smoked, like any ham;
and if there’s any more you’d know, about the way the shingles grow,
just ask me&mdash;here I am.”</p>

<p>I’ve admiration and respect for one whose knowledge is correct, so I
am strong for Dumm; no matter what you ask that guy, he always has a
prompt reply&mdash;and he makes business hum! Men should be ready with a
spiel about the goods in which they deal, excuses won’t suffice; our
estimate is always low of men who never seem to know a thing except the
price.</p>

<p>I’d like to deal in lumber, and sell, for honest mon, good shingles
without number, and scantling by the ton; I’d like to hand out timber
to patrons, all day long; the moulding, thin and limber, the pillar
firm and strong; for when a man is selling such things, which hit the
spot, to build the stately dwelling, the store and humble cot, he feels
that he is helping to push the world along, and so we hear him yelping
a sweet and joyous song.</p>

<p>I’d like to deal in lumber, for then I’d have a hand in rousing from
its slumber, the tired and stagnant land; whene’er I sold a package,
and put away the dimes, I’d say, “I’m building trackage, toward the
better times!” Pride’s blush would then be mantling my bulging brow
upon; and when I sold a scantling I’d help the old world on.</p>

<p>I’d help to build the silo, which fills a pressing need, in which the
rural Milo heaps up his juicy feed; I’d help to build<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span> the cottage in
which the Newlyweds consume their home-made pottage, with sunshine
in their heads; I’d help to build the palace where Crœsus counts his
chink, and hits the golden chalice when he would have a drink. I’d help
to build the cities, where busy people dwell; it is a thousand pities I
have no boards to sell!</p>

<p>I want to have a hand in all good things that’s going on; I’d hate to
be astandin’ two idle feet upon! I’d hate to deal in moonshine, or take
the shining plunk for goods which have the prune shine of gold bricks
or of junk. You’ll find some merchants funny throughout this blooming
earth; I’d not enjoy my money, unless I gave its worth; unless the
goods I deal in had useful end and aim, though coin came in a-peltin’,
I’d not enjoy the game.</p>

<p>I’d like to deal in lumber, in lime and lath, by jings, thus helping
to encumber the world with handsome things; I’d like to have a finger
in every worthy pie, I’d like my name to linger behind me when I die.
The lumber dealers figure in every useful scheme, in everything that’s
bigger than is an empty dream.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="GOOD_SIGNS">GOOD SIGNS</h2>
</div>


<p>When farmers bring their teams to town, and then drive home again,
their heavy wagons loaded down with boards and joists, why, then, it
is a sign that things are well, the goose is hanging high; and you may
safely dance and yell, for better times are nigh.</p>

<p>All farmers who are safe and sane like handsome cribs and barns, and
for old shacks that let in rain they do not give three darns; but
when the hogs are dying off, of cholera or mumps, the farmer, with
affliction filled, looks on the old shacks near, and says, “I can’t
afford to build until some other year.”</p>

<p>But when the hogs are feeling gay, and everything serene, and all the
oats and corn and hay present a healthy green, he hitches up old Kate
and Dick and journeys off to town, and then comes homeward pretty
quick, with lumber loaded down. And when I see the wagons drill along
the country road, each one a-creaking, loud and shrill, beneath its
lumber load, I know the country’s on the boom, and things will hum once
more; and any man who talks of gloom is just a misfit bore.</p>

<p>Some people read the Wall Street news to see which way we head, and
some keep tab on Henry Clews, to see if we are dead; some follow up
what Congress does, and think therein they’ll find the signs that
business will buzz, or maybe fall behind.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span> And some are making frequent
notes upon the tariff law, to see if it will get our goats, and
dislocate our jaw.</p>

<p>But when I want to know the truth, about our future fate, I pass up all
such things, forsooth, and sit on my front gate, and watch the farmers
going by, upon their way from town, and if with lumber piled up high,
their carts are loaded down, I know prosperity’s on top, good times are
here, you bet; and I go forth and whip a cop and chase a suffragette.
Oh, when the farmers spend their hoards for lumber, we enthuse; the
granger’s wagonload of boards tells more than Henry Clews.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="ADVERTISING">ADVERTISING</h2>
</div>


<p>Tell me not in mournful numbers, with the air of critics wise, that the
retail lumber dealer’s not the one to advertise.</p>

<p>“Let the shoe and grindstone dealers fill the papers with their ads,
let the pharmacists be spielers for their pills and liver pads; let
the dry goods merchant merry sing in print his cheerful tunes, let the
boatman boom his wherry, let the grocer boost his prunes. But when men
are buying shingles they will seek you in your lair, and will need no
prose or jingles to induce their going there.”</p>

<p>Thus I heard the mossback speaking as he sadly wagged his ears, and his
jaws and lungs were squeaking with the rust of many years. But I knew
his talk was twaddle that would fool no modern guys; for it’s true that
all men waddle to the stores that advertise.</p>

<p>Why should men who deal in lumber make no bid for larger trade? Why
should they sit ’round and slumber, slumber sweetly in the shade? If an
ad will bring new patrons to the gas works or the bank, if it sells new
gowns to matrons, why won’t it sell a plank? If an ad will bring new
buyers to the corner ginseng store, to the man who deals in plyers, why
won’t it sell a door?</p>

<p>In our town there is a dealer, selling lumber all the year, and he is
the boss appealer to the public’s grateful ear. Every day his little
sermon in the paper shows its face; when on building folks determine,
they go chasing to his place.</p>

<p>Keep your name before the public, keep your business house in view,
and when men would build a steeple, they will surely think of you.
Advertising pays, you bet you! They who say “No” are absurd. Never let
your town forget you&mdash;make your name a household word.</p>

<p>Our lumber man, McMellow, is quite a hustling fellow, he’s ever
after trade. He says, “I’ve faith in jumping around for biz, and
humping&mdash;I’ve always found it paid. I think,” remarks McMellow, “that
there’s a streak of yellow in any gloomy lad, who spends his time
complaining, against the breeching straining, and says that trade is
bad.</p>

<p>“My trade is what I make it; and I could blamed soon break it, if I
had doleful dumps, but when I find things dragging, I set my brains
a-wagging and do some fancy humps.</p>

<p>“Today I heard John Abel intends to build a stable, about eight miles
from town; as there was nothing doing, and no excitement brewing, to
hold this village down, I thought I’d go and meet him, and to some
language treat him, and sell a little bill; and right there I enrolled
him a customer and sold him the roof-tree and the sill.</p>

<p>“Keep busy is my motto; I have a small tin auto that scoots along with
vim; and when I hear some granger intends to build a manger, I burn the
road to him. The people see me scooting, they see me skally-hooting,
mile after breezy mile; they say, ‘He is so busy, he fairly makes us
dizzy&mdash;we kind o’ like his style.’</p>

<p>“And when they want some woodwork&mdash;and want the best of good work,
which is the Curtis kind&mdash;or joists or lath or siding, to me they come
a’riding&mdash;that’s business, do ye mind?”</p>

<p>You never see him slouching, you never see him grouching, or talking of
despair; he always keeps things humming, he’s always up a-coming, his
hind feet in the air.</p>

<p>Some merchants are so all-fired dumb, you wonder how they ever come
to sell the stuff they have in store, and keep the sheriff from the
door. Old Binkson is a lot that way; he seldom has a word to say. I ask
him for a pound of lime; he wraps it up, and all the time, he wears a
tragic air of doom, and sheds an atmosphere of gloom. He never chats,
he never spiels, nor jumps up high and cracks his heels. He isn’t
grouchy or unstrung; he never learned to wag his tongue.</p>

<p>Oh, silence is a golden thing, when ’tisn’t worked too hard, by jing.
But none of us will stand up strong for men who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span> gabble all day long,
and elocute a thousand miles in fifty-seven varied styles. The dealer
who is prone to talk until you hear him round a block, is worse than
t’other kind of bird, who’s never known to spring a word.</p>

<p>But if you’ve scantling you would sell, you ought to boost it wisely
well, and if a gent should buy a plank, to build himself a dipping
tank, you might suggest ere home he speeds, that you have other things
he needs.</p>

<p>I called on Lumber Dealer Gaff, to buy a shingle and a half. He put my
purchase in a sack, and wrapped a string around and back, and as he
toiled, in manner gay, he talked to pass the time away.</p>

<p>“The farmers now, in busy troops, are building stately chicken coops;
the winter soon will hit the road, and hens must have a warm abode, or
they won’t lay their luscious eggs, but stand around on frozen legs.”</p>

<p>And that recalled the fact to me that I had hens, some ninety-three,
and ere I left that lumber store, I bought a wagon load or more, of
stuff to build a chicken shed; it’s standing now, all painted red.</p>

<p>And that’s the way big sales are made, and that is how men build up
trade. Talk corn cribs at the proper time, or prove a silo is sublime,
but in an incidental strain, and not as though you gladly sprain your
conscience&mdash;which I hope is hale&mdash;in eagerness to get the kale.</p>

<p>Suggestion is a noble art; the wise man gets it down by heart.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_PIONEERS">THE PIONEERS</h2>
</div>


<p>Our fathers, in the bygone years, were bold and hardy pioneers. They
cleared the country of their foes, and made it blossom as the rose.
On prairies vast, by lonely lakes, they scrapped with Injuns and
with snakes, and whipped the large, fat grizzly bear, and chased the
groundhog to its lair.</p>

<p>When first they cleared their patch of ground, the pioneers felt they
were bound to build thereon some sort of shacks, so they got busy with
the ax. How dire and gloomy was their plight! There was no lumber yard
in sight; they could not take a bunch of cash, and buy their windows,
doors and sash; they could not seek the haunts of trade, and buy a
house already made. The modern man, who plans to build a house, with
children to be filled, can to the lumber palace go, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span> spend a little
roll of dough, and get his boards, all planed and grooved, so slick
they couldn’t be improved. And in a very little while he builds a house
that’s quite in style.</p>

<p>But it was different, my dears, with those old hardy pioneers; they
humped themselves like busy bees, and with their axes chopped down
trees, and of the branches made them bare, and chopped and chopped, and
made them square. And as they toiled around the boles, the Injuns shot
them full of holes. How would you like to build a shack, and have an
arrow in your back?</p>

<p>But still they toiled on tireless shanks, and fashioned doors of
three-inch planks, and made their windows, high and broad, all out
of plumb and wapperjawed. Oh, did they sing, or did they swear, when
interrupted by a bear, which sized them up as juicy food, and chased
them through the lonely wood? Oh, did they laugh, or did they wail,
when wildcats got upon their trail? For once an hour their labors
ceased; they had to scrap with man or beast. It’s hard to work ’neath
such a strain; it frets the heart and jars the brain.</p>

<p>Just ponder o’er those early shacks, all built with rusty saw and ax;
they once were viewed with lofty pride, in them our fathers lived and
died. How would you like it if you had to build log cabins, like your
dad? You’d surely think it pretty hard&mdash;you’d yearn for some good
lumber yard.</p>

We’ll build the house we long have planned, with modern things on every
hand, with weather strips and folding doors, and walnut stairs and
rosewood floors.”</p>

<p>“Now, Hiram, you are safe and sane,” remarks the glad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span> Amanda Jane.
“For twenty weary years, alack, we’ve lived in this old dingy shack;
we’ve built fine shelter for the cows, and sheds palatial for the sows,
and gorgeous stables for the mules, and lived in this old shack, like
fools. Now let us have a dwelling fine, and not a dugout twelve by
nine. And, Hiram, bear this thought in mind: When buying, do not go
it blind. I’ve talked with women who have homes which are for beauty
simply pomes, and they have told me many a time, that cheap john
woodwork is a crime. With it your house will be a frost, regardless of
the roll it cost.”</p>

<p>I tried to sell a load of slabs to Charles Augustus Clarence Dabbs. He
owns a farm some nine miles long, and twice as wide&mdash;unless I’m wrong;
I am not sure about its size, but it is big, or some one lies.</p>

<p>“I cannot blow myself for slabs,” said Charles Augustus Clarence Dabbs;
“with forty kinds of grief I’m filled, I’m not in shape this year to
build. When one is loaded to the ears with cares and woes, and doubts
and fears, he’s in no mood to talk of planks, or building stunts, you
bet your shanks.</p>

<p>“The government,” said Mr. Dabbs, “is on the farmers keeping tabs; it
looks to us to raise the wheat, that half the blooming world shall eat.
It looks to us for corn and hay, and succotash and beans and whey.
We farmers want to raise the stuff; we surely have desire enough; we
have the land, we have the mules, we have the seed, we have the tools,
but where in thunder shall we get the laborers, to toil and sweat? We
cannot keep men on the farm; the life appears to have no charm. I need
a half a dozen hands to cultivate my fertile lands; I’d give them work
the whole year round, if men of muscle could be found.”</p>

<p>“It is a problem old and hoar,” I said, and sat down on the floor. “It
is a problem that will grow more frightful as the sad years go, unless
you farmers realize that laborers are human guys. They want to live a
normal life, each with his fireside and his wife, and not be packed in
garrets bare up forty miles of winding stair.</p>

<p>“If I were farming, Mr. Dabbs, instead of selling rosewood slabs, I’d
build some nifty little shacks, to house my toiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span> Jills and Jacks.
I’d say to men I hired, ‘You see, you do not have to live with me;
you have your house in which to dwell, a garden and a cow and well, a
rooster and a Dorking hen, which things appeal to honest men.’</p>

<p>“When you take up that sort of thing, your men will stay with you, by
jing.”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Dabbs sat down by me. “There may be truth in that,” said he.
“I’m blamed if I don’t try it out, so let us see some plans, old scout.”</p>

<p>If there’s a wedding at the kirk, this lumber man will leave his work,
and reach the scene with active stride, and he’s the first to kiss the
bride.</p>

<p>When we arrange a big parade, you see this lumber man arrayed in all
his panoply and pomp, and down the street he’ll proudly romp.</p>

<p>If we decide to lynch a gent, some agent for a patent tent, or one
who’s sold us mining shares, or double action easy chairs, that lumber
man is right on deck, and puts the rope around his neck.</p>

<p>I hear folks say, “That lumber chap, has put this village on the map.
If we had twenty men like him, the town would sure be in the swim. He
is the first man, every time, to help to make things hump and climb.”</p>

<p>The business man who hopes to win must boost the town he’s living in.
You cannot do the hermit stunt, and hope to travel at the front. Get
next to all that’s going on, mix in with Richard, James and John, and
help along the town’s affairs, and leave the grouches in their lairs.</p>

</div>


<p>Some years ago I built a house in which I settled, with my spouse. It
was a gorgeous shack, indeed; the kind of house of which you read. For
such a house I’d always yearned, and so I said, “Expense be derned! I
want the best that coin will buy; my dwelling place must stack up high.
I want a dwelling that will stand till I’m so old I should be canned.”</p>

<p>I said, “I want a splendid stair, a stairway that’s beyond compare; the
kind you read about in books, with banisters and window nooks.”</p>

<p>And so we built a noble stair, and it was surely passing fair; and
guests who came to spend the night, when viewing it, expressed delight,
and said it surely took the cake; it was a bird, and no mistake.</p>

<p>But when the stair was five years old its antics made my trilbys cold.
It warped and twisted like the deuce, till half the steps and rails
were loose, it creaked and crackled, as in pain, and warped and bent
and warped again. It took a circus acrobat to climb my stairway after
that.</p>

<p>Then came a neighbor to my door, who’d built a hundred shacks or more.
He viewed my stair and shed some weeps, and said, “That is a frost,
for keeps. You’d better take it out from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span> there and get yourself a
Curtis stair. The wood the Curtis people use will ne’er its right
proportions lose; it will not wind around, I wist, like some dadblamed
contortionist. For it is seasoned to a hair; there is no reckless
guesswork there.</p>

<p>“The Curtis trademark on a stair just means that grief won’t travel
there. You have a stairway that will last until your earthly woes are
past, and you are playing golden lyres, or heaping brimstone on the
fires.</p>

<p>“Your warped old stairway yet will wreck some fellow’s back or break
his neck, so pull it down, I humbly beg, before there is a broken leg.
Then get the Curtis seasoned wood, and have a stairway staunch and
good, and you will bless me every day for showing you the proper way.”</p>

<p>And now a noble Curtis stair adds grace and comfort to my lair; I never
find it on the blink, it doesn’t warp or split or shrink.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ALL_THE_TIME">ALL THE TIME</h2>
</div>


<p>This is the burden of my rhyme: Be nice and pleasant all the time.
Some men are only sweet and nice, when they desire to get the price.
The lumber men at Bungtown hear that I intend, some time this year, to
build a handsome Gothic shed, all up to date and painted red.</p>

<p>At ordinary times these gents don’t smile at me worth twenty cents.
They pass me by and do not say, “How is your liver?” or “Good day!” But
since they’ve heard that I expect to build a shed that’s all correct,
a modern shed with wooden doors and handsome knotholes in the floors,
they’re so polite and smooth and sweet, they give me fantods in my feet.</p>

<p>They do not win me with their grins; such work is coarse, and seldom
wins. If men would sell their laths and lime, they should be pleasant
all the time, and not, like some cheap candidate, just when they think
’twill pay the freight.</p>

<p>I’ll buy the lumber for my shed, when I have got the coin ahead, from
dealers who are pleasant lads e’en when they are not after scads. There
are such dealers in our town, and no sane man would turn them down. I
meet them nearly every day, and talk with them of hogs and hay, and
bats and cats and curleycues, and ships and synagogues and shoes.</p>

<p>They do not seem to care a red who sells the lumber for my shed;
they’re always pleasant and polite, they hand me smiles and treat me
right.</p>

<p>So when I wish to buy a plank, I take some pennies from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span> the bank, and
cheerfully I blow the price with men who can’t help being nice.</p>

<p>And when the Bungtown fellows know what I have done, they’ll droop
in woe; they’ll look on me with moody scorn, and wish I never had
been born. Their souls can’t reach the heights sublime; they can’t be
pleasant all the time.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HOUSES_SCARCE">HOUSES SCARCE</h2>
</div>


<p>Oft I hear discordant slogans, hear the loud and sad lament; men are
wearing out their brogans hunting houses they can rent. Every village,
town and city sees the same discouraged crew; and it seems to me a pity
that good houses are so few.</p>

<p>In my native burg, Empory, I see women chasing round, and they tell the
same old story&mdash;houses simply can’t be found. And the same sad word is
spoken everywhere I chance to roam; from Topeka to Hoboken folks are
hunting for a home.</p>

<p>When they’re sick and tired of chasing, when their souls with woe are
filled, maybe they will do some bracing; maybe they’ll decide to build.
Rents are higher now than ever, and the prices won’t slump back, and
that man is really clever who will build himself a shack.</p>

<p>“But the cost!” I hear men yawping; and they put up thoughtless roars,
for they never have been shopping at the modern lumber stores. Building
goods today are cheaper than all other goods you buy; all commodities
are steeper&mdash;ask the lumber dealer nigh.</p>

<p>Monied men are often questing for gold bricks, and dern the price;
always ready for investing in blue sky and pickled ice. If they’d build
a lot of houses they might dwell in Easy street, where the catawampus
browses, and the dingbat’s song is sweet. Every time they’d build a
dwelling crowds would come, and still increase, crying, clamoring and
yelling, begging for a five-year lease.</p>

<p>There’s no better proposition than this thing of building homes, and
the fact should find position in the plutocratic domes.</p>

<p>And the man with modest bundle should be renting nevermore; he should
take his wad and trundle to the lumber dealer’s store.</p>

<p>There should be a boom in building such as we have never seen; palaces
with ornate gilding, modest homes, all painted green.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FLOORS">FLOORS</h2>
</div>


<p>The Eskimo has floors of ice, and probably he thinks them nice, and
strictly up to date; but if there ever came a thaw they’d be the worst
you ever saw, and that’s as sure as fate. The Arab has his floor of
sand; I have no doubt he thinks it grand, a floor beyond compare; but
sand is full of bugs and ants, and they climb up a fellow’s pants, when
he sits in a chair.</p>

<p>The Mexican has floors of dirt, and floors of that sort will not hurt,
so long as weather’s dry; but when there comes a season wet such floors
are not the one best bet, which no one can deny.</p>

<p>In olden times men built their homes with battlements and towers and
domes, and ornaments of gold; but all the floors were made of stone,
and they made people sigh and groan, they were so hard and cold.</p>

<p>And then with rushes they were strewn, to make them warmer to the
shoon, and also to the feet; and those stale rushes would decay; their
scent would drive the folks away, in agonized retreat.</p>

<p>It took uncounted years of toil and planning by the midnight oil to
dope out modern floors; the floors on which we dance and walk, and sing
and cuss and wildly talk of hoarders and such bores.</p>

<p>The floors on which we spend our lives, and train our kids, and beat
our wives, are surely handsome things; be they of color light or dark,
we proudly view them and remark, “They’re good enough for kings.”</p>

<p>Your mansion might have jasper walls, the finest painting in its halls
that artists can produce, and onyx stairs and marble doors, but if it
had no modern floors ’twould be a poor excuse.</p>

<p>Good hardwood floors make life a pome; they beautify your happy home as
nothing else can do; your lumber dealer has the best; the years have
given it the test that means so much to you.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="DOORS">DOORS</h2>
</div>


<p>While doing here our earthly chores, we’re going in and out of doors;
doors have a part in all we do, until our little trip is through; and
then who knows what sort of door we’ll enter on the other shore?</p>

<p>If I am welcome at your shack you gladly swing the door clear back, and
say, “Come in, you blamed old skate, and stay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span> six months, or maybe
eight!” But if I sell “The Works of Poe,” you ope the door an inch or
so, and cry, “Go chase yourself, gadzooks! We do not want your tinhorn
books!”</p>

<p>Oh, doors are good for many things; they’re used by peasants and by
kings; the humblest hut has three or two, and palaces have quite a few.
And I recall a bitter day, when I climbed on a dappled gray, a horse
that wasn’t brought up right; it liked to kick and buck and bite; it
threw me off, in wanton style, then sat on me for quite a while. I was
so crippled, bruised and sore, men took me home upon a door. It shows
how useful doors can be; I always carry two or three.</p>

<p>We’re always viewing doors, you know; they face us everywhere we go;
on doors we knock, at doors we wait, and if they’re handsome, smooth
and straight, they strike us as a work of art, they’re soothing to the
mind and heart. But if they’re warped and out of plumb, and cracked and
cheap and on the bum, we think, “The owner doesn’t heed how much his
dwelling runs to seed.”</p>

<p>I size up people by their doors; not by the rugs upon their floors.</p>

<p>There’s nothing looks so dad-blamed punk as some cheap door that’s
warped and shrunk.</p>

<p>The Curtis hardwood doors are great; they’re always true and fine and
straight; their beauty gladdens every eye, and years don’t make that
beauty fly. They’re built by experts, and each door is planned to sell
a hundred more; each one’s an ad for all the rest, and every Curtis
door’s the best.</p>

<p>Oh, I could write a whole lot more, but some one’s rapping at the door.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BUILDING_A_HOUSE">BUILDING A HOUSE</h2>
</div>


<p>I built a house, erect and square, its basement touched the ground; and
all my neighbors gathered there, and said it should be round. “Square
houses long are out of date,” remarked old Jabez Black, “and no one but
a fossil skate would build him such a shack.”</p>

<p>“I see your shingles are of wood,” said Johnsing, with a grin; “you
ought to know they are no good&mdash;they should be made of tin. Your house
is sure the bummest job a man could find in town; I’ve half a mind to
raise a mob, and come and tear it down. The porch roof has too steep a
drop, it makes a wretched show; the basement should be built on top,
the garret down below.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>“You surely must have lost your head,” exclaimed old Captain Bean, “to
go and paint your mansion red, with trimmings of pea green. A person’s
eyes it fairly slams; the man who sees that paint will think he has the
James H. Jams, and he’ll be apt to faint. If you had made it pink and
blue, it would have hit the spot; but you have chosen such a hue as
makes the neighbors hot.”</p>

<p>“I see your chimney is of brick,” said Colonel Sassafras; “and such a
bungle makes me sick&mdash;it should be built of glass. Glass chimneys now
are all the rage in Paris and in Rome, but you’re away behind the age,
when you put up a home.”</p>

<p>“Upon a pivot,” said Judge Ace, “it should be built, just so, then you
could turn it round to face most all the winds that blow.”</p>

<p>They all agreed that such a shack was never built before; it all
was wrong and out of whack, from roof to cellar door; except the
woodwork&mdash;that was grand, and beautiful and slick; they saw it had the
<span class="smcap">Curtis</span> brand, and so they could not kick.</p>

<p>All Spring it rained to beat the band, and o’er the saturated land, the
water stood in pools; old Pluvius, who runs the rain, it seemed, had
water on the brain, and busted all the rules.</p>

<p>The farmers had to sail in boats when they went forth to feed their
shotes, their ostriches and cows, and when they went to sow their beans
they had to go in submarines, they couldn’t use their plows.</p>

<p>And in the cities things were worse, and gloomy as a country hearse was
nearly every face; men stood around in dripping crowds, and viewed the
stretch of leaking clouds, and called them a disgrace.</p>

<p>Contractors, when they called on Hoar, who runs the corner lumber
store, would make an awful fuss; “this is the blinkest, blankest
Spring! We cannot do a doggone thing! It’s getting wuss and wuss! It
keeps on raining all day long, the mud goes through to old Hong Kong,
it will not dry till fall; unless the gods give us a show, out to the
poorfarm we must go, our families and all!”</p>

<p>But Hoar, the cheerful lumberman, is one who always ties a can to every
gloomy thing; his optimism then he voiced, as he wrapped up a big oak
joist, and tied it with a string.</p>

<p>“The rain,” he said, “is coming yet, and I admit it’s pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span> wet, in
fact it’s almost damp; but you should hail it with delight, and shoo
your troubles out of sight, and bid your griefs decamp. The ground is
soaked clear through, you say, down to the center of Cathay, and that
is joyous news; it means good crops for sundry years, so it’s a sin to
sprinkle tears, or languish in the blues. The moisture stored in yonder
soil will make our divers kettles boil, and bring us coin galore;
you’ll have more palaces to build because the air with rain is filled,
so please cut out the roar.”</p>

<p>The man who sees the good in things, who chirps around and smiles and
sings, and chortles by the year, not only boosts his private trade, but
sees the ghosts of others laid&mdash;the ghosts of doubt and fear.</p>

<p>One dealer cannot understand why people needing planks or sand go past
his door, to spend their mon with t’other dealers, Dadd &amp; Son.</p>

<p>His stock is just as good as Dadd’s; he gives as much for patron’s
scads; why, then, do people pass his door, and pass him up forevermore?
Perhaps he lacks the sort of charm that will all prejudice disarm, that
makes his gladsome patrons shout, “I like to deal with that old scout.”</p>

<p>A man may study all the tricks of commerce, trade or politics, may
know his biz from A to Zed, and yet still fail to get ahead, if he
has not that winning way that makes a new hit every day. One doctor’s
good at making friends; from door to door he blithely wends, and fills
his patients up with pills, and cheerfully they pay his bills. This
doctor’s soon in Easy street; his motor choos along the street, he
wears large diamonds on his tie, his life is one long piece of pie.</p>

<p>Another sawbones knows full well all lore the physics books can tell.
He studied medicine in Rome, and studied it some more at home. He knows
all corners of his game, all ailments of the human frame, and he could
cure the hopeless guy that other docs give up to die. But people say,
“We’d rather croak than have that sour-faced doctor bloke!”</p>

<p>And thus it is in every line; the man who deals in coal or pine, the
man who sells a churn or farm, should have that asset men call “charm.”
With that on tap the world goes slick, and people say you are a brick;
they buy your hats, they buy your gourds, they buy your beeswax, beans
or boards. And if you lack it they will trot to one whose manner hits
the spot.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PLANTING_A_TREE">PLANTING A TREE</h2>
</div>


<p>On Arbor Day I took a spade, and then a large round hole I made, and
planted there a tree; and in that tree, in coming days, the birds will
sing their roundelays; and twitter in their glee.</p>

<p>I am an ancient also-ran; I am an old and feeble man, I soon must hit
the flume; but it’s a pleasant thing to know that there will be that
tree to show, when I am in the tomb. Beneath its boughs the kids will
play, and veterans all bent and gray will in its shade recline; and
peradventure one will sigh, “I well recall the dippy guy, who planted
here this pine. The swath he cut was very small, while he was on this
mundane ball, but when life neared its end, this tree he planted with
his spade, and here we’re resting in its shade, and bless him as a
friend.”</p>

<p>And as the long, slow years go by, perchance that stately tree will
die; there’s death for all, it seems, and men, to earn the needed
plunk, will separate its mighty trunk, and fashion boards and beams.</p>

<p>And one who plans to build a shack, will to the lumber dealer track,
and purchase beam and board; and carpenters will straightway go, and
build as fine a bungalow as mister can afford. The walls and roof of my
good tree, will shelter human grief and glee, for, maybe, untold years;
will echo to both sob and song, the laughter of the bridal throng, the
plash of old wives’ tears.</p>

<p>I like to speculate this way; but now my boy comes in to say, ere he
departs for school, “That tree you planted by the fence now looks like
twenty-seven cents&mdash;it’s dead as Cæsar’s mule.”</p>

<p>When people do their Christmas shopping, and blow in all their
hard-earned ore, to keep the Christmas spirit popping, they don’t call
at the lumber store.</p>

<p>You do not see the Christmas spieler, with purse ajar and eyes a-gleam,
say to the cheerful lumber dealer, “Just wrap me up that ten-foot beam!
I have an aunt, Priscilla Hocking, to whom I’d send a present small;
that beam will surely fit her stocking like the paper on the wall.”</p>

<p>You do not hear the shopper saying, “I want a gift for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span> Uncle Hank, so
let me see you busy weighing about ten yards of basswood plank.”</p>

<p>No shoppers tighten their surcingles in lumber yards, at Christmas
time, and buy their girls a lot of shingles, or sundry pecks of
unslacked lime.</p>

<p>A man might think the lumber dealer was off the map, and in the shade,
without a tendril or a feeler upon the blooming Christmas trade. But
all the year they’re building houses, with stuff the lumber dealer
sells, in which the Christmas crowd carouses, and good old Santa whoops
and yells. Beneath yon roof there’s joyous laughter, that indicates
good will to men; and every two-by-four and rafter came from the lumber
dealer’s den. The walls on which you see the holly, were furnished by
the lumber man, who is, like Claus, serene and jolly, and does his
stunt the best he can. The door at which the guest is greeted with
kindness which should hit him hard, and everything that’s nailed or
cleated, comes from the modest lumber yard.</p>

<p>You cannot have a Christmas frolic, with joy and laughter in the air,
and nuts and candies&mdash;causing colic&mdash;but that the lumber man is there.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_NEW_YEAR">THE NEW YEAR</h2>

<p>The old year’s gone where dead years go, the New Year comes across the
snow, and chortles at the door; it seems to say, “Behold in me the
smoothest year you’ll ever see&mdash;none like me came before!”</p>

<p>But years, my friends, are much the same; they stay a while and play
their game, and then they disappear; they’re modeled on the same old
plan; success depends on Mr. Man, and not on any year. The finest year
that ever grew will bring no rich rewards to you, if you’re a shiftless
chap; the poorest year that they can send will see you prosper without
end, if you have vim and snap.</p>

<p>We shouldn’t wait for friendly gods to come and multiply our wads, or
fetch us wood to burn; the new year isn’t apt to bring to you or me a
doggone thing that we don’t go and earn. We shouldn’t dream when New
Year comes, or sit around and twirl our thumbs, and wish ourselves good
cheer; ’twere better far to count our breaks and figure up the bad
mistakes that cost us much last year.</p>

<p>“The lumber man across the way is doing business every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span> day, while I
sit here and mope; there is some reason, sure, for that; I’ll find it,
too, or eat my hat,” thus muses David Dope. And so he rustles ’round
to find why trade is falling far behind; that’s better far, old scout,
than quoting pretty New Year rhymes and harking to the clanging chimes
that ring the old year out. “You bet,” says David, and he grins, “this
year I’ll guard against the sins that put me in the hole; I’m bound
this year will treat me well, so watch your Uncle David sell his
lumber, lime and coal.”</p>

<p>And thus the year is good or bad according to the sort of lad who has
it by the horns; if you are bound to win, you will; if not, the year
your hopes will kill, and spoil your choicest corns.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
